                Liu Kang is one of the most popular and accessible characters in the series. He is one of Earthrealm's
                greatest warriors, having defeated many to prove his valor. Throughout the series, he has been gradually
                portrayed as the main hero, becoming champion after the first Mortal Kombat tournament. Kang has found a
                nemesis in the traitorous Shang Tsung, a sorcerer who he has defeated on numerous occasions. He is often
                considered the greatest threat to the plans of Shang and his emperor, Shao Kahn. He is a member of the
                White Lotus Society and trains extensively at the Wu Shi Academy. It was at the Academy that he was
                murdered by a Deadly Alliance of Shang with Quan Chi.<br><br>

                In the first entry in the series, Liu Kang was shown to be non-violent, in that his finisher did not
                graphically kill the opponent. Starting with Mortal Kombat II, however, all of his Fatalities were more
                gruesome.<br><br>

                His body was resurrected without his spirit in Mortal Kombat: Deception. This physical half killed
                hundreds of innocent people, with the skills he refined to protect them while he was alive. Liu Kang
                retained his personality as a zombie, as he still had his trademark yells. A notable exception is the
                intro of Armageddon, where he groans like a recognizable zombie.<br><br>

                He is said to be one of the Great Kung Lao's last descendants through various media (a trading card, the
                first film, etc.) It is possible that Liu Kang and Kung Lao are cousins. He is referred to as the
                "Immortal Champion of Mortal Kombat" in later games, and his ending in Mortal Kombat: Deception has him
                again assuming the role upon his restoration to life.
